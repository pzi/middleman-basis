  - Refactored helpers to make use of the data files, too.
  - Meta tag helpers now scream at you, in case you are doing it wrong ;) (thanks @jordanmaguire for the help)
  - Updated README with all the new goodies and information

## v0.3.1

Date: 2015-04-29

Changes:
  - Removed conditional comments around `<html>` tag to move the web forward! The decision to remove conditional comments happened after reading up on it on the [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) repository. Especially https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1290 and https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1187

  **Note:** In case you need to support legacy browsers, commit 571f2d49d82b86c89c00dcb2e42ce3795beab10b shows you how it can be done.
  - Indent size of `[*]` is now 2 spaces (again) – not sure how it got to 4 before :neutral_face:
